1
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:22,419
Oh so someone is out here.

2
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:26,079
Surprising, this time of night.

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm out here sometimes, just singing to myself.

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,659
Um that song doesn't have a name, only a little tune I thought of this morning.

5
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,359
I thought I'd come out here to try it out in peace.

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,359
I don't live far from here, so I take the occasional walk.

7
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,579
Do you live nearby?

8
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,860
It is peaceful out here, yes.

9
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,020
It's why I like coming out here to sing in peace.

10
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,580
It's too loud where I live, and there's always interruption.

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,059
Come sit with me.

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,079
I enjoy splashing the water bit.

13
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,399
I only go into town for basic necessities.

14
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,720
I try to avoid it.

15
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,540
Is that what we are all about?

16
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,239
What we do?

17
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,320
I'd rather know what you like, what you care about.

18
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:45,019
Sure, I am unemployed, if you want to call it that.

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,919
Can't we play out this little mystery a bit longer?

20
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:53,699
You've met strangers in the night, and you ask if they have a job?

21
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,759
Singing feels like a job sometimes.

22
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:04,079
If only I had someone to hear me sing, even just a little.

23
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,079
.

24
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:37,359
It might not be a familiar tune, but I have had it on my mind for a while.

25
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:42,439
I feel like I'm not singing it strongly enough.

26
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:51,439
Voice carries a power that can break through walls and travel long distances.

27
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,819
You don't know where I first heard this melody, and yet I've brought it to you.

28
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,979
And if you learned it, you can take it anywhere to anyone.

29
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,519
When I sing, I want my voice to turn heads, stir hearts.

30
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:15,139
It can invade minds and lie dormant into some wake moment in your mind.

31
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,459
Even soulless sounds like commercial jingles have that power.

32
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,979
Um I don't know about that.

33
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,699
I can sing whatever I want right now, and I can sing for whoever I want.

34
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:42,039
Um my family is, um, complicated.

35
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,859
My singing doesn't stand out, really.

36
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,459
We are all singers.

37
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,399
It's just, I just want to sing for fun.

38
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,659
Um

39
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,899
our reasons for singing are really different.

40
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,199
You wouldn't understand.

41
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,399
My family and I, we are sirens.

42
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,539
We're sometimes called mermaids too.

43
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,599
I'm not going to do anything to you.

44
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,759
It takes a while to transform my tail into legs anyway.

45
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,539
If you want your own, just go ahead.

46
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,979
I don't just tell anyone what I am.

47
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,659
I have to be careful.

48
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,179
We all do.

49
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,819
We travel between water realm trying to stay hidden.

50
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,879
We've even resulted to hiding in lakes.

51
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,419
No, I don't live in this lake.

52
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:57,599
My family hasn't found this one yet, so I use it to just be alone sometimes.

53
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,399
My family's gotten a little aggressive lately.

54
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,319
There are lots of sirens out there.

55
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:14,159
But with more and more humans infiltrating more parts of the ocean, we have to keep running.

56
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,899
I'm going to pretend you didn't make a "just keep swimming" joke at me.

57
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:29,319
I can't really stop you, but still, please don't tell anyone about me.

58
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,279
I won't come back here again.

59
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,679
I'm not supposed to talk to humans anyway.

60
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,439
My family's joined some other sirens trying to get back at humans or whatever.

61
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,219
They've been following large boats to reel humans into the sea.

62
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,039
It was my family's idea to go after cargo ships.

63
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,599
That's not possible.

64
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,559
There are so few sirens left in the world.

65
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:00,539
All we're doing is just buying time until we all die out.

66
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,419
It's simply over for us, and they just refuse to accept it.

67
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,479
I don't know what else to do or where to go.

68
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:18,799
I can only do a few hours out of water, and walking with my leg is so tiring.

69
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,659
I just try to stay out of their way.

70
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:27,099
Besides, it's not like they need me anyway.

71
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,739
I wouldn't be useful.

72
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,679
I can't walk a lot or do much, just sit and sing in one place.

73
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,419
What do you mean stay with you?

74
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:46,099
Why? Why would you do that?

75
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,599
That's sweet, but I don't know.

76
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,799
What would I even do?

77
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,539
I wouldn't want to be an inconvenience to you.

78
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,859
Fine. I, I do want the offer.

79
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,159
Yes, I want to stay with you.

80
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,259
Yeah, go ahead.

81
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,879
I will wait here.

82
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:26,619
It will take me a minute to get my legs going anyway.
